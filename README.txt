MaskDetector.ipynb contains code for building, training, testing, and exporting a mask detection model using mobilenetv2
Trained model is exported as mask_detector.model
RealTime.ipynb uses constructed model along with face detection model provided by OpenCV to perform face mask detection
in realtime

Simply open RealTime notebook and run. Please make sure required dependencies are installed.
